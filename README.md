# Design-of-4-Way-Traffic-Light-Controller-Based-on-Finite-State-Machine-FSM-Using-Verilog
The objective of this project is to develop a traffic light control system using Verilog and Proteus. The algorithm for doing this is based on Finite State Machine
(FSM) .

## Description
There are four roads: East, North, West, South. The green light will go on
circularly in the counter-clockwise direction. The green light will remain on for 20
seconds. In this period all other roads will be red. Then, the yellow light will light
up and the next road to be green will be in a red-yellow state to caution the
drivers. The system will be in this state for 4 seconds. There are also sensors in
each road which will determine if there is a jam, emergency in the road or if the
road is empty.
